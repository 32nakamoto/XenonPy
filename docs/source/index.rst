Overview
========

**XenonPy** is a Python library that implements a comprehensive set of machine learning tools
for materials informatics. Its functionalities partially depend on PyTorch and R.
The current release (v0.2.0, 2018/12/25) is just a prototype version, which provides some limited modules:

* Interface to public materials database
* Library of materials descriptors (compositional/structural descriptors)
* Pretrained model library **XenonPy.MDL** (v0.1.0b, 2018/12/25: more than 10,000 models in 35 properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic compounds)
* Machine learning tools.
* Transfer learning using the pretrained models in XenonPy.MDL

Features
========

XenonPy has a rich set of tools for apply materials informatics rapidly.
The descriptor generator class can calculate several types of numeric descriptors from ``compositional``, ``structure``.
By using XenonPy built in visualization function. The relationships between descriptors and target properties can easily be shown in a heatmap.

We have a great confidence in transfer learning. To facilitate the widespread use of transfer learning,
we have developed a comprehensive library of pre-trained models, called **XenonPy.MDL**.
This library provides simple API to enable users to fetch the models via a http request.
To play with pre-trained models, some useful functions are also provided.

See :doc:`features` for details
