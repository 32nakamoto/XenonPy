Any code in this directory is not officially supported and may change or be removed at any time without notice.

The contrib/sample_codes directory contains source code directories from contributors that may not be revised by the XenonPy developers.
It is meant to share different examples of XenonPy usage for different applications.
User with a similar problem setup can reference these codes and use them as a starting point to develop new codes.

When sharing sample codes, please stick to the following rules:
1. Create a new directory in `contrib/sample_codes`.
2. Either provide a `README.md` under the root of the project directory, e.g  `contrib/my_project/README.md`, 
or include some headline information in the beginning of the Python file/jupyter notebook.
3. Include a brief explanation of the purpose of the code. (Sharing contact info is recommended in case of any enquiry from other users)
